# samd21_QFP_reference_PCB

This is a reference design for a SAMD21 for easy SWD programming and testing.  This layout should work with any SAMD21 QFP package. That includes the following:
- SAMD21E15 32kB of Flash
- SAMD21E16 64kB of flash
- SAMD21E17 128kB of flash
- SAMD21E18 256kB of flash

I wanted to start to try SWD programming and these are the less expensive version of the popular SAMD21G on Adafruit and Sparkfun boards.
This PCB design relies heavily on Adafruit and Sparkfun reference design.
